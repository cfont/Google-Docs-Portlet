About the Portlet

The purpose of this portlet is to bring the functions of Google Docs closer to the user in Liferay.  Instead of just providing a link to go to Google Docs, this portlet allows them to create, list, search, sort, share and view information about their documents without ever leaving the portal.  In fact, the end goal is that the user only has to jump into a new window to actually edit the document contents.

Below is a screenshot showing what this portlet can do.  The interface is not yet complete and the features are not all represented. However, this should give you a good idea of the direction of this project.  If you're a developer interested in contributing to this project, please visit the "Getting Involved" page.  Even if you're not a developer there are ways to contribute.

When paired with a Google Apps domain and SAML single sign-on, this portlet is even more powerful.  Users will not have to authorize the portlet to retrieve their documents.  It can be configured to use the OAuth consumer key and secret for two-legged OAuth authentication.  

When used with a regular, consumer Google account, the portlet will have to use three-legged OAuth, requiring user interaction the first time.  This is not an option in the current version of the portlet.

By default, the first 100 documents are loading into the portlet and paginated.  Each document displays an icon in the first column to easily denote what type it is.  In the future, this column will also display a tooltip with more information about the document - owner, created time, who it is shared with, etc.  The right column features an actions menu that will allow users to export/download, delete, organize or share the document.  Columns will be sortable - by default the documents are displayed in descending order by last time modified.

Users can easily create a new document, spreadsheet, presentation, or drawing by entering a title and choosing a document type.  Users may also search for a document.  There will be a dropdown or other mechanism to allow users to choose the type of search - title or full text.

In the end, users will also be able to organize their documents into folders/categories.
